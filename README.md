        Velocity is a performance optimization tool designed with gamers in mind, aiming to enhance the overall efficiency of a Windows system. Inspired by feedback from gamers who seek smoother and faster gaming experiences, Velocity focuses on clearing out unnecessary temporary files that accumulate over time, consuming valuable disk space. In addition to file cleanup, the program optimizes system services and tasks, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively. By identifying and shutting down unnecessary background processes and fine-tuning system settings, Velocity helps free up system resources that would otherwise be used inefficiently by Windows. This results in improved performance, faster load times, and a more responsive system, ultimately contributing to a better user experience for those who demand the most from their PCs.
